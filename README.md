# JUnit 5 and Mockito in Java 21 ðŸš€


## Overview
This repository contains practical examples of unit testing using JUnit 5 and Mockito in a Java 21 environment. Through various test cases, it demonstrates how to integrate JUnit to validate business logic and how to use Mockito to create mocks and perform isolated dependency testing.

The goal is to show how these tools facilitate test-driven development (TDD) in enterprise applications and simplify the testing lifecycle.
